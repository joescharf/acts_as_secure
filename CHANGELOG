  notes:
    - Fixed AR serialization - now adds "serialize" to the model when adding callbacks
    -- Added secure_column_symbols to return an array of columns to be secured, as symbols. Not very DRY, but works for now 
    - Defaulting to :text fields instead of binary for :storage type. To allow storing base64 encoded encrypted data
    - Need to verify :only and :except returns a valid set of columns to secure - haven't tested this much at the moment.
